# Password Generator

## Description
This application was created for homework assignment #3 at the Coding Boot Camp at Johns Hopkins University. This is my first website using JavaScript to dynamically update HTML and CSS elements. 

After clicking "Generate Password", the user is prompted to select a password length between 8-128 characters, and then choose which character types they would like to include. Once the password has been generated, it can be copied to the clipboard.
